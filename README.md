# HeartMail

When working in a remote location, it’s easy to feel disconnected from loved ones. Sometimes you really want to know that your loved one is okay, and you can’t wait for “the right time” to send a message. The HeartMail wearable shares heartbeat data using NASA’s Sense-It technology and communication satellites. Stay connected to someone important with HeartMail. You can feel each other’s heartbeat anytime, giving you peace of mind, even when you’re a world away.
